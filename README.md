# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the price of Airbnb listings based on various features such as property type, room type, location, amenities, and host characteristics. 

 # Overview 
 
Airbnb provides a platform for property owners to rent out their spaces to travelers. Pricing a listing effectively is critical for maximizing revenue while staying competitive in the market. For hosts, understanding what factors influence the price of their listings is essential.
